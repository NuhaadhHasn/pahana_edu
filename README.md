## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Design

The application is built on a **3-Tier MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

-   **SOLID Principles:** The design strictly adheres to SOLID principles:
    -   **SRP:** Each class (Controller, Service, DAO) has a single, well-defined responsibility.
    -   **OCP:** Controllers and Services are open for extension but closed for modification.
    -   **LSP:** The `DiscountStrategy` interface allows different promotion types to be used interchangeably.
    -   **DIP:** Controllers depend on Service interfaces, not concrete classes.
-   **Design Patterns:**
    -   **Singleton Pattern:** Used for the `DBConnection` to ensure a single, efficient database connection.
    -   **Factory Pattern:** The `ServiceFactory` decouples controllers from service implementations.
    -   **Strategy Pattern:** Used for applying different promotional discounts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Database:** Ensure you have a MySQL server running. Execute the `pahana_edu.sql` script to create the database, tables, and sample data.
2.  **Configuration:** Update the database credentials (`DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`) in the `src/main/java/com/example/pahanaedu/dao/DBConnection.java` file.
3.  **Build:** Build the project using Maven (`mvn clean package`).
4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the generated `.war` file to an Apache Tomcat 9.0 server.
